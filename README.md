Sharing some of my works for practice and classes

This is just a collection of some of the work I had to do in classes or as hands-on projects. The main purpose is to show my use of code. I am aware that in some of them since only the coding was required at the time, I did demonstrate concern about other readers. That involves a random selection of variable names and a lack of comments and explanations to readers. Here most of the work is in R, also with some in Python or Tableau.
